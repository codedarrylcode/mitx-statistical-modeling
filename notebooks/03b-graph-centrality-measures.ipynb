For example, degrees (in/out degree), propagated degree (e.g. if friends of my friends are also important, i.e. a node has a large centrality has neighbours that have large centrality), closeness, betweenness (where removal may break the network) of networks.\n",

    "\n",
    "    For undirected graphs, the degree $k_i$ of node $i$ is the number of edges\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Undirected graphs: $k_i = \\sum_{j} A_{ij}$\n",
    "    - Directed graphs: in-degree ($k_{i}^{in} = \\sum_{j} A_{ji}$) and out-degree ($k_{i}^{out} = \\sum_{j} A_{ij}$)\n",

    "    Simple and intuitive: Individuals with more connections have more *influence* and access to information. But does not capture the importance of their connections.\n",

    "2. **Closeness centrality**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Tracks how close a node is to any other node, by computing the inverse of the average distance to all nodes, i.e small average distance is equivalent to high closeness\n",
