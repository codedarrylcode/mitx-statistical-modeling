    "**Why Environmental Data?**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "By using data such as air/water quality, temperature and other measurements, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand underlying processes, changes (e.g. climate change, *'statistics of weather over time'*)\n",
    "- Impacts on environment, health, economics, society\n",
    "- Shape policies\n",
    "- Forecast events, warnings (*e.g. seismic network, storms, ...*)\n",
    "- Resource/energy management, *e.g. water, renewable energies*\n",
    "- Use in planning, routing, backtracking, control\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying questions and techniques are easily transferrable to other domains. Some of the questions asked are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationships (correlations, association) in temporal, spatial dimensions\n",
    "- trends; forecasting\n",
    "- planning (*e.g. where to place more sensors for better measurements*)\n",
    "- quantifying uncertainty, adaptive sensing\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in environmental data, we'll be interested in some of these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting animal populations: Usually, animal populations serve as indicator of healthy ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting disease: Environmental data can provide contextual information about disease spreading. For example, how temperature changes and rainy seasons impact the spread of malaria in the tropics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Renewable energy predictions: Clear understanding of wind speeds, water levels in damps, or underground thermal activity provide information for renewable energy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicting extreme events: extreme events like storms and floods are usually modeled and predicted to incorporate action plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Policy making: for example pollution concentrations measurements in the air can help the design of guidelines for industry contaminants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of modeling flow data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forward prediction: simulate (propogate) distributions, including variation in time\n",
